    <h3>
        AI (artificial intelligence) is –
        It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.
<br>
         It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence.
         <br>
        AI is the ability of a machine to display human-like capabilities such as reasoning, learning, planning and creativity.
        <br>
        Artificial intelligence (AI) is a wide-ranging branch of computer science concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. While AI is an interdisciplinary science with multiple approaches, advancements in machine learning and deep learning, in particular, are creating a paradigm shift in virtually every sector of the tech industry. 
        <br>
AI has become a catchall term for applications that perform complex tasks that once required human input, such as communicating with customers online or playing chess. The term is often used interchangeably with its subfields, which include machine learning (ML) and deep learning.

        GOALS OF AI
    </H1>
    <h3>
        There are four potential goals of AI, which differentiates computer systems on the basis of rationality and thinking vs. acting:
<br>
Human approach:
Systems that think like humans
Systems that act like humans
<br>    
Ideal approach:
Systems that think rationally
Systems that act rationally
