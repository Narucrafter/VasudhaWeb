  <h1>Utilization of AI in Daily Life</h1> 
  <h2>1)Voice assistants</h2>
  <br>
  <h3>
    Digital assistants like Siri, Google Home, and Alexa use AI-backed Voice User Interfaces (VUI) to process and decipher voice commands. AI gives these applications the freedom to not solely rely on voice commands but also leverage vast databases on cloud storage platforms. 
  </h3>
  <h2>2)Entertainment Streaming Apps
</h2>
  <br>
  <h3>
    Streaming giants like Netflix, Spotify, and Hulu are continually feeding data into machine learning algorithms to make the user experience seamless. 
    Carefully looking at the user's interaction with various media, these streaming apps recommend custom content. Using AI to parse through the ever-increasing user data, these apps create catalogs of music, movies, and TV series suited to each individual user's liking. 
    
  </h3>
  <h2>3)Personalized Marketing
</h2>
  <br>
  <h3>
    Brands use AI-driven personalization solutions based on customer data to drive more engagement. A report revealed that 88% of the surveyed consumers stated that more personalized content makes them feel better about a brand.

  </h3>
  <h2>4)Navigation and Travel

</h2>
  <br>
  <h3>
    The work of AI programmers behind navigation apps like Google Maps and Waze never ends. Yottabytes of geographical data which is updated every second can only be effectively cross-checked by ML algorithms unleashed on satellite images.
  </h3>
  <h2>5)Facial Recognition Technologies
  </h2>
    <br>
    <h3>
        The most popular application of this technology is in the Face ID unlock feature in most of the flagship smartphone models today. The biggest challenge faced by this technology is widespread concern around the racial and gender bias of its use in forensics.

    </h3>
    <h2>
        6)Security and Surveillance
    </h2>
      <br>
      <h3>
        AI frees up human surveillants to focus on the verification of crucial incidents and act upon them. The constant monitoring and detection part of surveillance is taken up by AI video monitoring software. AI can pick up irregular behavior that might sometimes be missed by human eyes.
      </h3>
      <h2>
        10)Internet of Things
    </h2>
      <br>
      <h3>
        The confluence of AI and the Internet of Things (IoT) opens up a plethora of opportunities to develop smarter home appliances that require minimal human interference to operate. While IoT deals with devices interacting with the internet, the AI part helps these devices to learn from data.
