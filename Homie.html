        Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as one of the most transformative and revolutionary technologies of the 21st century. It is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines capable of simulating human-like behavior, understanding, and decision-making processes. The primary objective of AI is to develop systems that can perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as problem-solving, learning, perception, and language understanding.</h2>
